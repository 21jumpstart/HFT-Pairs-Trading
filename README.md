# High Frequency Pairs Trading Strategy
Python code for backtesting a high frequency intraday pairs trading strategy

Authors: Zhuping Xu and Xingbo Fu. All rights reserved.

We develop an intraday high frequency pairs trading strategy based on mean reverting strategy. It generates high cumulative P&L when we back test using intraday data from 8/21/2017 to 3/2/2018. 10 stock pairs are selected from S&P 500 stocks using correlation and cointegration test at the beginning of each month. We test the strategy using frequencies of 1 min, 5 min, 10 min and 15 min. We also test using different transaction costs.

However, the code is not well organized so far. We are going to rewrite some parts of the code and will update the code ASAP.
